System Design Concept

## Motivation

### System
After few years of Software Engineering experience, I found out that system design is pretty interesting. For last year(2021), I had a chance to implement small system from scratch. With little guidance from senior developer, designing a whole system is real problem. The place where I studied and got knowledge was [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/), which has one of the biggest system running.  

For 1 year, I studied server-client concept, cache, messege queue, loadbalancing, redundancy, etc, and at the same time, I applied those concept to prototype of our company's system.  

After off boarding from the project, I thought these knowledges could be core knowledge of mine. So I decided to revisite all thoes concept and organize what I know about system.

### Go?
At the same time, I decided to learn Go language. After few month of studying and implementing servers with Go, I got to like its features of binary build, strong typing, performance, and ease of learn.

The most interesting part was goroutine part, because what I used right before was Node.js which is single threaded. After tweaking goroutines and channels(go communication method between different goroutines), I decided to apply this in actual project.

I thought that implementing some kind of simulation of servers will be a good use case for using goroutine.

## Concept
- Implementing server that simulate system design principals
    - system - client
    - loadbalancer
    - redundancy
    - cache
    - message queue
    - etc.
- Show simulation in client(web browser)

## TBD
